Overview
This is a modern full-stack starter kit that blends React with AdonisJS. It ships with Shadcn UI components, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and tRPC. Itâ€™s designed as a production-ready monorepo to help you build fast web apps without reinventing the wheel. You get a clean separation between the backend API and the frontend UI, while sharing data types and utilities where it makes sense.

- Clear conventions for structuring code, testing, and deployment

Key features
- TypeScript everywhere for safety and maintainability
- Shadcn UI integrated with Tailwind for a cohesive look
- tRPC for end-to-end typed API calls between client and server
- AdonisJS as the back end for robust server features and a friendly DX
- Production-ready monorepo layout with clear boundaries

Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or newer
- PNPM 8.x or newer (recommended for monorepos)
- A modern shell (bash/zsh) and Git installed
- Basic familiarity with TypeScript, React, and a backend framework

Quick start
- Create a new project by cloning this repo and installing dependencies
- Start the frontend and backend in parallel
- Visit the local URLs to see the app running
- Use the release assets to bootstrap the project when needed

Installation
- Install dependencies from the repository root
  - pnpm install
  - If you prefer npm or yarn, you can adapt, but PNPM is recommended for monorepos
- Copy or create a local environment file for services (see .env.example in the relevant app)
- Ensure your database or data stores are reachable using the environment configuration

Running locally
- Start the backend (AdonisJS)
  - cd apps/api
  - pnpm install
  - pnpm dev
- Start the frontend (React + Vite)
  - cd apps/web
  - pnpm install
  - pnpm dev
- Run both simultaneously using a workspace filter or a script
  - pnpm -w run dev:all
  - Or use a process runner like concurrently if you prefer a single command
- Typical endpoints and pages
  - API: http://localhost:3333 (default AdonisJS port)
  - Web: http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port)
- Environment and data
  - Local databases should be configured via .env files in each app
  - Use the sample .env.example to guide the required variables

Development workflow
- Code with a focus on clarity and type safety
- Use shared types to prevent API drift
- Keep UI components small and reusable
- Write unit tests for key utilities and API endpoints
- Run linters and formatters on save or as part of pre-commit hooks
- Document any non-trivial API or UI behavior in docs/

Backend overview (AdonisJS)
- Core responsibilities
  - REST or GraphQL-like API with typed routes
  - DB access via Lucid models
  - Business logic layers and services
  - Security, authentication, and authorization concerns
- How to extend
  - Create services in apps/api/app/Services
  - Add controllers and routes under apps/api/start/routes
  - Add or modify Lucid models under apps/api/app/Models
  - Use environment variables to manage DB connections and credentials
- Common patterns
  - Repository-like data access for testability
  - DTOs for request/response shaping
  - Dependency injection for testability and decoupling
- Example workflow
  - Define a new route
  - Implement a controller
  - Use a service to execute business logic
  - Return a typed response to the client

Frontend overview (React + Vite)
- Core architecture
  - A React app powered by Vite with fast refresh
  - Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn UI components for consistent design
  - A typed client communicating with the AdonisJS backend via tRPC
- Key patterns
  - Shared hooks and utilities in packages/utils
  - A design system in packages/ui built with TypeScript
  - Typed API clients and generated types for safe integration
- Component strategy
  - Small, focused components that can be composed
  - Clear separation between presentational and container components
  - Accessibility considerations baked in from the start
- Data flow
  - Use tRPC routes for the API layer
  - Use React Query or built-in fetch wrappers for data fetching and caching
  - Normalize data shapes with shared TypeScript types

Shared libraries and patterns
- UI components
  - Reusable components that match the Shadcn UI aesthetic
  - Theming with Tailwind's dark mode and color tokens
- Utilities
  - HTTP clients with consistent error handling
  - Date/time utilities, formatting helpers, and validation utilities
- Types
  - Shared TypeScript types for API payloads and UI models
  - Utility types for deep partials, pick/omit patterns, and discriminated unions
- Architecture guidance
  - Favor small, testable units
  - Prefer explicit types over any
  - Document decisions and trade-offs in docs/

Testing and quality
- Testing approach

FAQ
- Do I need AdonisJS to use this starter kit?
  - Yes. AdonisJS powers the backend in this setup, providing a solid API surface and server-side features. The frontend talks to it via a typed API layer.

  - The design system and structure are geared toward React, but the architecture allows adapters to other frameworks with some work.
- Is this production-ready?
  - Itâ€™s built with production best practices in mind. You should tailor it to your projectâ€™s needs and review security and performance considerations for your deployment target.
- How do I add new UI components?
  - Add components to packages/ui, export them from an index, and document usage in docs/components.
